# folder-structure
This app is build to make a directory tree structure


[✔️] A user should be able to click on a folder item, upon clicking, the folder will be expanded - showing the files and folders inside of it.

[✔️] Use the data object to mimic a real world data folder scenario.

[✔️] The <Folder /> component takes in a prop called files - which is the data object that we talked about earlier.

[ ❌ ] Based on the type of the file, appropriate extension icon should be visible right next to the label. For example, a index.js file will show a JavaScipt icon. [As of now, changes are not made ]

[✔️] Appropriate paddings and margins should be provided to the children files and folders.
[ Done ] If a file is not a folder - nothing happens.
